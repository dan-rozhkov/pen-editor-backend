// POST /api/browse/locate's decision core — a one-shot sibling of
// decideBrowseStep (browseStep.ts): resolve a natural-language element
// description to a single element index with ONE Jev Choice call, for
// browse_act's `element` field (tools.ts). Where decideBrowseStep answers
// "what should happen next" from a goal and full page state across many
// steps, this answers one narrower question — "which of these elements is
// THE ONE the caller already described in words" — against a single fresh
// snapshot, so it reuses decideBrowseStep's element scrubbing/truncation
// (capAndScrubElements) and its target-head criterion rendering
// (elementCriterionLabel) rather than re-deriving either. See
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-full-browser-use-design.md for the
// bridge-side contract this sits behind, and browseStep.ts's own header for
// the shared Jev/vendor conventions (peak-probability gating, PII
// scrubbing, fail-open on transport errors).

/** The browse_act operations `element` can be resolved for. HOVER is

 * element — like decideBrowseStep's target_click head, a HOVER lookup
 * reuses the CLICK candidate set (see isCandidateFor below), since hovering
 * is only ever meaningful on something also clickable/focusable. FOCUS is
 * browse_act's `press` action's element-targeting operation: pressing a key
 * (Enter, Tab, …) can meaningfully target a button, a text input, or a
 * `<select>` alike, so it accepts ANY of CLICK/TYPE_TEXT/SELECT rather than
 * being pinned to one — resolving `press` against CLICK alone (the old
 * behavior) could never match a text input, which is exactly the field
 * Enter is usually pressed in. */
