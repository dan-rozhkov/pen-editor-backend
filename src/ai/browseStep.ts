// 2026-09-20 revision, driven by TypeSafe's own jev-1.13 model-jaggedness
// notes: (1) `state` carries a COMPACT digest of the elements (index, tag,
// truncated label, ops — no value/options, no repetition of what the target
// criteria already spell out in full) rather than either the full element
// objects or nothing at all — see buildBrowseStepQuestions and the
// `state.elements` comment below for why neither extreme was right; (2)
// DONE/BLOCKED are no longer forced to compete with concrete actions inside
// the operation Choice — an absolute judgment ("is the goal met at all?")
// is a Noul, not a relative one ("which of these options wins?"), so
// they're now two Noul questions in the same fan-out, decided before the
// operation is even read; (3) the confidence gate reads `probabilities`
// (peak probability), not the vendor's `confidence` field, because
// `confidence` is a deterministic function of the option count
// (`(n*peak-1)/(n-1)`) — a fixed threshold on it is stricter on a simple
// 2-option page than a 40-option one, backwards from what we want; (4)
// thresholds scale with the operation's risk via three named constants
// (PEAK_THRESHOLD_OP / _TARGET / _PASSIVE) — a peak below the relevant one
// is a terminal `blocked`, full stop; there is no non-terminal middle band
// (a 2026-09-20 sub-revision removed one — see PEAK_THRESHOLD_OP's comment
// for why a same-page retry can never produce a different peak, which is
// what made that band a disguised `budget` failure rather than a real
// retry); (5) SELECT no longer calls the generative STRUCTURED_MODEL — its
// answer space is a bounded, enumerable set of real page options, exactly
// the case jev-1.13's own docs say belongs to a Choice, not generation.
//
// 2026-09-20 revision, round 3 (review of the above): (6) `state.elements`'
// per-element digest line dropped `isPassword`/`hasValue` entirely — see
// elementDigestLine's comment — which meant a CLICK on a login page's
// "Sign in" button, or a TYPE_TEXT whose target head happened not to land on
// the password field itself, sailed past the hard credentials rule that
// only ever looked at the TYPE_TEXT target element in isolation; both flags
// are back as short digest markers, never the field's real value; (7) the
// `goal_met` Noul used the same 0.65 bar on step ONE (empty `history`) as it
// does after real progress has been made — see NOUL_GOAL_MET_EMPTY_HISTORY_THRESHOLD's
// comment for why an empty history now demands the stricter original 0.8.

/** Terminal `retry`-band removal (2026-09-20 sub-revision): a mid-band peak
 * used to resolve to a non-terminal `retry`, on the theory that "the loop

 * decideBrowseStep's answer is a pure function of the SAME page state the
 * client already sent (goal/url/title/history/elements); nothing about the
 * page changes between one call and the next unless the client itself acts
 * or navigates first. A `retry` therefore re-sends an identical fan-out,
 * gets an identical peak back, and repeats until the step budget is spent —
 * a `budget` failure wearing a `retry` costume. Below the relevant
 * threshold is a straight terminal `blocked`, restoring the semantics
 * addendum B actually specifies: `retry` is reserved for transport
 * failures, malformed answers, and missing candidates — cases where the
 * NEXT call can plausibly differ from this one.
 *
 * Three separate thresholds, not one, because option count and stakes both
 * vary by head:
 *  - the operation head (PEAK_THRESHOLD_OP) is a Choice deciding WHAT CLASS
 *    of thing happens next — CLICK/TYPE_TEXT/SELECT/HOVER/PRESS_ENTER is
 *    the acting case; and
 *  - the passive case (PEAK_THRESHOLD_PASSIVE) covers the same head when it
 *    lands on SCROLL_UP/SCROLL_DOWN/WAIT/PRESS_ESCAPE — a wrong scroll or
 *    Escape costs nothing, so it gets a materially lower bar than an acting
 *    pick from that same Choice; and
 *  - the target head and the SELECT-option head (PEAK_THRESHOLD_TARGET) can
 *    each fan out over up to 120 (elements) or 100 (select options)
 *    near-duplicate candidates, and every choice they produce is validated
 *    by exact membership against the criteria keys the question was built
 *    from (see the target-index validation below) — a wrong pick there is
 *    caught structurally, not just probabilistically, which is why it can
 *    sit at a lower bar than the operation head despite also being
 *    "acting."
 * The password rule stays a hard terminal rule regardless of any of these
 * three numbers, never threshold-gated.
 *
 * 2026-09-25: a same-day live-bench round trip. Lowering this to 0.45 (and
 * PEAK_THRESHOLD_TARGET to 0.35) was tried first, on a 47-step replay of the
 * bench-shop task, and looked like a clear win while the cascade fallback sat
 * on `deepseek-v4.1-flash` (2.6s per cascade call): decision time 56s→28s
 * over the corpus. But that number bundled two effects together — fewer
 * cascade calls AND a slower cascade model — and once BROWSE_CASCADE_MODEL
 * moved to `openrouter:google/gemini-2.5-flash` (~0.9s per call, 27/30
 * judged-correct on the hardest replay steps) the comparison could be redone
 * cleanly: 9 live runs per config, same cascade model both times. At the
 * lowered gates (.45/.35), CLICK picks in the 0.45-0.6 band were fine, but
 * TYPE_TEXT picks in that SAME band typed into the already-filled search box
 * instead of the real target, and CLICK picks in that band skipped required
 * steps (selecting a product before filtering/sorting) — 7/9 correct
 * end-to-end, 31s task-wall median, 0.64s/decision. At the original .6/.5
 * gates: 9/9 correct, 33s task-wall median, 0.74s/decision. With a fast,
 * accurate cascade the lowering buys roughly 0.1s per decision and costs
 * correctness outright, so it's not worth it — the gates are reverted to
 * their original values. (Lowering only ever paid off against the slow
 * deepseek cascade; it was never a property of the gates themselves.) */

 * Review finding #1: a candidate that only PARTIALLY overlaps a PII or URL
 * span (a phone number's "555", an email's local-part fragment "Daniil", a
 * credentialed URL's "Secret") used to reach the vendor completely
 * unflagged, because candidatePiiKind only recognizes a candidate that IS a
 * whole PII value — a fragment of one scrubs to itself and reads as
 * ordinary text. This locates every PII span (findPiiSpans, the SAME
 * detectors scrubPii itself redacts with) and every URL span in the RAW
 * goal first, then drops any candidate whose span overlaps one of them
 * UNLESS the candidate's span is exactly that PII span — in which case it
 * survives as a candidate (candidatePiiKind still recognizes it whole, and
 * chooseTypeTextCandidate below still offers it only as a "[candidate N:
 * kind]" placeholder, never as raw text). A URL match is never offered even
 * whole — "http://example.com/reset?token=..." is not a value to type
 * anywhere, so any overlap with it drops the candidate outright, exact
 * match or not.
 *
 * Several overlapping strategies on purpose, ordered so that the ones most
 * likely to isolate a single clean value (a quoted string, an email, a
 * number, a "search for X" phrase) win a candidate slot before the noisier,
 * higher-recall ones (capitalized-word runs, raw comma segments) start
 * competing for the MAX_TEXT_CANDIDATES cap — see the goal example in this
 * file's tests (a checkout sentence naming a product, a brand, a price, and
 * a full "Name, email, country" clause) for why no single strategy covers
 * every shape a goal takes. Deduped case-insensitively; each candidate is

 * model's free-text answer ("AudioNova") legitimately omits.
 *
 * Review #8 (reverted): this used to ALSO strip a trailing ellipsis
 * ("…"/"...") unconditionally, so a real page option that happened to end
 * in one, and the SAME option's own truncated cascade-prompt rendering,
 * silently normalized to the identical string — and worse, two genuinely
 * DIFFERENT options ("Other" and "Other...") collapsed to the same
 * normalized value ("other"), making `exactCiMatch`'s `find` (which returns
 * only the FIRST match) pick whichever happened to sort first, regardless
 * of which one the model actually meant. `resolveSelectOptionText` now
 * handles a truncateLabel-truncated answer as an explicit PREFIX match
 * instead (see its own comment) — this function no longer touches ellipses
 * at all.
 *
 * Review B1: also normalizes every quote-shaped character (`"` `'` ‘ ’ “
 * ”) to one canonical form — a real page option like `27" Monitor` and a
 * model/cascade echo of it as `27' Monitor` (or with curly quotes) are the
 * same value with a cosmetic quote-style difference, not a real mismatch.
 *
 * Round 4 review #5: `toCascadePromptSafeText` neutralizes `<`/`>` to
 * `‹`/`›` before an option ever reaches the cascade prompt (so page text
 * can't fake a closing tag) — so the model's "copy verbatim" answer for a
 * real option like `"< $50"` comes back as `"‹ $50"`. Mapping `‹`/`›` back
 * to `<`/`>` here undoes exactly that one substitution for comparison
 * purposes, without reintroducing any injection risk: this function is
 * comparison-only, its output is never re-embedded in a prompt. */

 * `scrubbedGoal`. Live bug (2026-09-25): the cascade prompt used to be built
 * from `scrubbedGoal` (plain `scrubPii`, bare non-reversible "[EMAIL]"/
 * "[PHONE]" tags), so on a goal like "type the email" it could only answer
 * with that bare placeholder — and the placeholder got typed into the page
 * verbatim. This function now builds its own prompt goal via
 * `buildNumberedPlaceholderGoal(goal)`, the SAME numbered-token mechanism
 * generateTypeText already uses, so the model can be told apart between
 * several PII values of the same kind and can only ever echo a token back —
 * never the raw value, which is substituted LOCALLY afterward by
 * `resolvePlaceholderTokens`. The Jev fan-out's own `state.goal` is
 * unaffected by any of this — it stays on plain `scrubbedGoal`, built once
 * by the caller and passed through unchanged. On any failure to reach a
 * confident, valid decision, returns a CascadeRejection with the reason
 * (caller falls back to the original terminal `blocked`); a rejection
 * reason is diagnostic-only text (operation names, thresholds, our OWN
 * literal strings) and must never echo page-derived text (an element
 * label, an option) back into it.
 *
 * `allowDone` (finding #8): false on the target/select gate paths, where
 * Jev's operation head has ALREADY confidently chosen a concrete op
 * (CLICK/TYPE_TEXT/SELECT/HOVER) and only the target/option choice failed
 * its own gate — "is the goal met" is not what was asked there, so the
 * cascade may only pick a target/option or fail, never declare the task
 * done out from under an operation Jev already committed to. On the op-gate
 * path it also folds in a PRE-check the caller runs before ever starting
 * this call (see decideBrowseStepCore's own comment at that call site):
 * `false` there too when the SAME step's own `goal_met` noul is known and
 * clearly low (CASCADE_DONE_MIN_GOAL_MET) — 2026-09-25 finding: rejecting a
 * `done` reading AFTER the fact (a `CascadeRejection`) on an unchanged page
 * just re-asks the identical question next step, since nothing about the
 * page moved; a below-threshold `goal_met` is known BEFORE the cascade call
 * even starts, so the fix is to never offer `done` as an option in the
 * first place. When `allowDone` is false the prompt below tells the model
 * outright that the task isn't finished, rather than inviting a `done`
 * reading only to reject it afterward — a `done: true` answer anyway is
 * still caught by the ordinary `!allowDone` check right below and rejected
 * exactly like any other cascade failure (the caller's own gate stays
 * `blocked`, never a special-cased outcome). Runs on
